# Inside-Out Algorithm

The Inside-Out Shuffling algorithm shuffles a stream of numbers. The highlight of this algorithm is that it works even if we do not know the number of elements to shuffle.

Another highlight of this algorithm is that it is not in-place which means it creates a new copy of the stream of elements shuffled randomly.
